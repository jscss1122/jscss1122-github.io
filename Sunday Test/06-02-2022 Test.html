    <p><h4> Ahilya Fort, in the central Indian town of Maheshwar, sits high above the sacred river Narmada.<br>
         Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar ruled here from 1765 to 1796 and built Ahilya Wada, her personal residences,<br>
          offices, and darbaar audience hall, within the fort.

        In the year 2000, Prince Richard Holkar, her descendant and son of the last Maharaja of Indore,<br>
         converted his home in Ahilya Wada into a guest residence, today known around the world as the Ahilya Fort Hotel.</h4></p>

         <p> The Ahilya Fort Hotel has 19 rooms of character, set in six buildings of the 18th century, with modern amenities and comforts.<br>
           Guests stroll through 3 acres of courtyards, fountains, and gardens that link areas within the Wada. It is easy to find a secluded <br>
           spot to read a book, sip some tea, or just watch the butterflies flutter by.
          NB: Many of our rooms are accessed via a flight of 10-15 steps, however ground floor rooms are available on request.
          
          The hotel is well located to explore the highlights of Maheshwar, including its bustling village markets and riverside complex<br>
           of temples and cenotaphs.</p>
